# API
API at golang with gin framework

On this project I am realizing API for pseudo-store of plants.
Now you can test these HTTP methods: GET, PUT, POST and DELETE,
of course you also can use method GET like get item by ID.

The data is stored at local postgres in docker, the credentials is stored in code
for now.
